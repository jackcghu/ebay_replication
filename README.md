# eBay Paid Search — Difference-in-Differences Replication

A reproducible replication package estimating the causal effect of eBay's
paid search advertising on revenue, based on the natural experiment analyzed
by Blake, Nosko, and Tadelis (2014) and presented in Chapter 5 of Taddy (2019).

## Research Question

What is the effect of paid search (SEM) advertising on eBay's revenue?

---

## Data

The dataset (`input/PaidSearch.csv`) contains daily revenue observations for
210 designated market areas (DMAs) from April to July 2012. In 65 treatment
DMAs, eBay stopped bidding on Google AdWords on May 22, 2012. The remaining
145 DMAs serve as the control group.
